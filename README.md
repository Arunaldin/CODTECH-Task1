OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

Project:Simple Calculator to perform arithmetic operations.

Objective:The objective of this basic calculator program is to provide a simple, interactive tool that allows users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers. 

The basic calculator program in Python will allow users to perform simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program will be interactive, guiding the user through a series of steps to input the necessary values and select the desired operation.

Key Features:
1.User Input:
The program will prompt the user to input two numbers, which can be integers or floating-point numbers.
The user will be asked to select an operation by entering a corresponding symbol (+, -, *, /).

2.Operation Selection:
The program will display a menu or ask for a specific input that represents the desired arithmetic operation.
It will handle the selected operation and ensure that the input is valid.

3.Calculation:
Based on the user's choice, the program will perform the selected operation on the two numbers.
For division, the program will check if the second number is zero to avoid a division-by-zero error.

4.Display Result:
After performing the calculation, the program will output the result to the user.
The result will be clearly labeled to show which operation was performed and the resulting value.

5.Error Handling:
The program will include basic error handling for invalid inputs, such as non-numeric input for numbers or an invalid operation selection.
It will provide appropriate messages to the user and prompt them to try again.

6.Modular Design:
The program can be structured using functions to handle different parts of the calculation, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.

This project serves as a foundation for understanding user input, basic arithmetic operations, and error handling in Python. It can be extended with additional features such as more operations, input validation, or a graphical user interface (GUI) in future iterations.
